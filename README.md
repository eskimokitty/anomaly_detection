# Anomaly Detection Project
- Main python code: src/main.py
- 4 test cases created in insight_testsuite/tests
- created a map of map to track friends network
- created a map of priority queue to track users' most recent T purchase history, more details available in the code comment section
- time complexity analysis
  - friend/unfriend: O(1)
  - process historical purchase history: O(log(T))
  - process new purchase transaction: O(n)
- spent around 6 hours on it due to busy work schedule
- if there's more time available, I will try to enhance the following areas:
  - add more test cases. I encountered json parsing ValueError while creating my own json input log files. 
  - update readme section 
  - make source code more organized
